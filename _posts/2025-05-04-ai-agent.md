# AI Agent Hello World

##  Google ADK
Use Google ADK to create an async [agent](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart-streaming/#5.-build-custom-app) with adk streaming and fastAPI
* built in google search tool for quick setup
* built in web interface for interacting `adk web`
* orchestration/session management/etc
* all u need is to create an API key 


## LangGraph
Use LangGraph to build a simple [chatbot](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/#part-3-adding-memory-to-the-chatbot) with DeepSeek API
* orchestration/session management/etc
* learning curve is high 

## n8n
* basically no code platform, rely on drag and drop
* learning curve for node input/output
* rich template support


## Workflow vs Agent
* Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
* Agents are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.
